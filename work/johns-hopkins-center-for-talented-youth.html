		For decades, the CTY team has provided unique services and programs for the families of young scholars with exceptional academic abilities. While families rave about the courses, many complex processes had developed over the years making it difficult to understand what CTY offers and to enroll in testing and courses.
	</p> <h2>My Role</h2> <div class="columns"><p>
			I led a team of 6 that included visual designers, ux designers and a writer. I was responsible for defining the overall plan, bringing multiple streams of work into a cohesive vision, and guiding the client stakeholders through a process that, to them, was new and complex. I was especially hands on with research, facilitation, and user experience design.
		</p> <div><img alt="Two people facing a white board discussing a sticky note" src="/photos/work/cty/cty-kickoff.jpg"></div></div> <h2>The Solution</h2> <p><img alt="A triptych of a UI, a family photo and a page from a tone of voice guide" src="/photos/work/cty/cty-deliverables.jpg" class="project-hero"></p> <p>Our team delivered a completely new brand and digital experience, detailing all of the key interactions in the lifecycle of a family's participation in CTY. We also created robust persona sets that model the complex dynamics observed in the research families and a wealth of information from user validation sessions.</p> <p>This work provided the entire organization with a new, shared language for their common aspirations and a new perspective on how families experience CTY through many different phases of interaction. The mindset shift drove changes in business processes, communications and program positioning.</p> <p>It was an absolute joy to work with an organization so dedicated to creating a great experience for their service users.</p> <h2>My Takeaways</h2> <ol class="bulleted-list section"><li>Building a solid foundation in brand and user modeling makes it easier to harmonize many streams of simultaneous transformation work.</li> <li>Different user models can be created for different design needs.</li> <li>Teams that like each other and have a lot of fun are incredibly productive.</li> <li>Teams that center the perspective of service users are more aligned and effective.</li></ol> <a href="/work" class="project-cover--button">View Other Work</a></div></div> <div class="footer-container"><footer class="footer layout"><div class="footer-contact"><p>
