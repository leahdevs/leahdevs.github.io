			Every year, an army of volunteers across the US coordinates the registration, ordering and administration of AP exams. This involves tracking every student in AP classes, whether they plan to take the exam, parental permission, payment, recruiting proctors, and handling exam materials. Historically, each coordinator is given a manual detailing rules and procedures and the rest is up to them.
		</p> <div class="columns"><p>
				CollegeBoard decided to develop a new service to support coordinators through the entire process. In addition, they wanted to create tools that make it easier for teachers to support coordinator activities and to encourage students to commit to taking exams for the AP courses they are enrolled in using recommendations from Stanford researchers.

			This project had a small team. I acted as researcher and primary UX designer in collaboration with another part time UUX designer, a visual designer, and stakeholders within CollegeBoard. I led primary research with AP coordinators across the country, led CollegeBoard product teams through a large story mapping exercise and created concepts and a detailed UX framework. I also liasoned with CollegeBoard's central design group to ensure compliance with UX and brand standards and to propose new components to be added to the design system, many of which were included.

				A key deliverable we created was a set of detailed journey maps for AP coordinators, teachers and students. The project stakeholder group engaged with these throughout the project, hanging it up in their office. It was referred to again and again to resolve prioritization conversations or think through process changes. It also formed the basis for the storymapping excercise that aligned multiple product and service groups around a single MVP definition.

			The second phase of this project involved the creation of a detailed UX framework. We dove into all the intricacies of tracking student information, ordering, administering and returning exam materials. Our designs were rolled out to coordinators and have saved countless hours of spreadsheet manipulation, support calls and tracking down students in the hallways. That time is now used to give more support to students to make sure they have the tools to succeed.
		</p> <p><img alt="A diagram showing many interconnected screens" src="/photos/work/collegeboard/collegeboard-flow.jpg"></p> <p>
			This was another successful example of a large, complex project going off without a hitch because of the alignment that comes from commitment to centering service users.
